# unit-4-game


in javascript

lines 4 - 16 set variables

lines 21 - 50 create functions to assign random numbers to each button

lines 50 - 64 created a reset function to run at the beginning and after each win or loss

lines 80 - 93 created an on click function to get the value from the clicked <div> and add it to a running total

lines 97 - 109 if/else statements. trying to use these to determine the possible outcomes


the game would start and keep adding the values and would alert "you win" if the compterNumber was matched,
but would not stop the game if the number was matched or the user score was > computerNumber. I am now wondering if i need the if/else
statement inside a funcion or what?  This is the tricky part for me, laying out the step by step process.
